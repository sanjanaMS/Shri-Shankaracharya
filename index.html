      According to one tradition, Shankara was born into a pious Nambudiri Brahman family in a quiet village called Kaladi on the Periyar (Purna) River, Kerala, southern India.

      On the bank of the Jamuna, a great sage was seated in contemplation when some brahmin girls came there to bathe. One of them had a baby two years old. She placed him by the side of the sage and asked him to take care of it till she bathed. The baby slowly crawled into the river and was drowned. The mother was aghast. She took out the dead body of the child and wept bitterly before the sage. The sage was quite oblivious of the happenings awoke from his samadhi. He was moved by pity for the grieving mother. By the powers of his yoga, he left his body and entered the body of the child. The dead child sprang into life. That child was Hastamalaka. This explained how he came to have such an all-comprehensive knowledge without any apparent instruction.

    <h2><span class="sur"> Sri Sureshwaracharya</span></h2>
    <h3>as the Acharya of Sringeri Sharada Peetham in the South.</h3>
    <img class="sur" src="sur.jpg"alt="height="150px" width="150px"" />
    <p>
      Sri Sureshwaracharya was a great scholar, and a philosopher of repute. He was the first Peethadhipati of Dakshinamnaya Sringeri Sharada Peetham, established by Sri Shankarabhagavatpada.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sri Sureshwaracharya wrote elucidating metrical commentaries (Vartikas) on Taittiriya and Brihadaranyaka Upanishadic Bhashyas of Sri Bhagavatpada. Sri Sureshwaracharya also wrote commentaries on the Dakshinamoorti Stotra and Panchikarana of Sri Bhagavatpada. The commentary on Dakshinamoorti Stotra became famous as the Manasollasa Vartika. He also wrote a succinct monograph presenting an analytical picture of the fundamental teachings of Sri Bhagavatpada. This book became well-known as Naishkarmya Siddhi. Sri Sureshwaracharya also wrote a commentary called Balakrida on the Smriti of Yajnavalkya. Next to Sri Bhagavatpada, he stands as the foremost author in the field of Advaita.

    <h2><span class="sri">Sri Padmapadacharya</span></h2>
    <h3>the Acharya of the Dwaraka Math in the West.</h3>
    <img class="padma" src="padmapada.jpg" alt="height="300px" width="300px"" />
    <p>
      He was first of Shankara’s disciples. He was first in more than one sense. His unrivalled devotion so pleased the teacher that, in appreciation of his earnest search for truth, the Acharya took the trouble of explaining to him his works thrice. This partially engendered in the other disciples a feeling of misgiving, which the Acharya immediately took care to eradicate.

    <h2><span class="tot">Sri Totakacharya</span></h2>
    <h3>the Acharya of Jyotir Math in the North.</h3>
    <img class="thotaka" src="thotaka.jpg" alt="height="150px" width="150px"" />
    <p>
      Once when Totaka had gone to the river for washing clothes, the Acharya waited for his arrival before he would begin his exposition. The other disciples were impatient. Padmapada could not restrain himself. He said: ‘Why should we wait for one who is no better than a wall?’ Sri Shankara naturally did not relish this remark. He felt the necessity to teach Padmapada. So by a mental flash, he endowed Totaka with all the knowledge of the sastras.
        When Totaka returned from the river, he was literally in bliss. He addressed the Acharya in a few brilliant stanzas in Totaka metre. Since then, known before as Giri, he got the title of Totakacharya. He was counted among the foremost disciples of Sri Shankara. He condensed the essential teaching of the Upanishads in a small treaties. This is called Sruti Sara Samuddharana composed in the same Totakametre.
